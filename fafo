usage="fafo: version 1.0 07.06.2017, Martin Rosellen

This script can be used to traverse through all the subdirectories of the current working directory and execute a command as if executed from the subdirectory. 'fafo' stands for 'For All FOlders'. Please note that this only works for subdirectories and not for sub-sub-directories ('fafo directory_in_subdirectory/command' will not work). Please use the script 'fasub' for that.

Example:

Try './fafo ls' to output the contents of all subdirectories.

usage: fafo <command> [<output_subfolder_name>] or -h 

where:
<command>	specifies the command that should be executed in the subdirectories

optional:
<output_subfolder_name>		if a second argument (e.g. "1") is given fafo displays the current subdirectory operating in
-h       			show this help text"


while getopts ':hs:' option; do
	case "$option" in
		h) echo "$usage"
		exit
		;;
	esac
done

# execute command in every folder

for d in */ ; do
    cd $d
    if [ $2 ]
    then
    	echo $d
    fi
    $1
    cd ..
done
